    "5 Levels Of Text Splitting\nIn this tutorial we are reviewing the 5 Levels Of Text Splitting. This is an unofficial list put together for fun and educational purposes.\n\nEver try to put a long piece of text into ChatGPT but it tells you it\u2019s too long? Or you're trying to give your application better long term memory, but it\u2019s still just not quite working.\n\nOne of the most effective strategies to improve performance of your language model applications is to split your large data into smaller pieces. This is call splitting or chunking (we'll use these terms interchangeably). In the world of multi-modal, splitting also applies to images.\n\nWe are going to cover a lot, but if you make it to the end, I guarantee you\u2019ll have a solid grasp on chunking theory, strategies, and resources to learn more.\n\nLevels Of Text Splitting\n\nLevel 1: Character Splitting - Simple static character chunks of data\nLevel 2: Recursive Character Text Splitting - Recursive chunking based on a list of separators\nLevel 3: Document Specific Splitting - Various chunking methods for different document types (PDF, Python, Markdown)\nLevel 4: Semantic Splitting - Embedding walk based chunking\nLevel 5: Agentic Splitting - Experimental method of splitting text with an agent-like system. Good for if you believe that token cost will trend to $0.00\n*Bonus Level:* Alternative Representation Chunking + Indexing - Derivative representations of your raw text that will aid in retrieval and indexing\nNotebook resources:\n\nVideo Overview - Walkthrough of this code with commentary\nChunkViz.com - Visual representation of chunk splitting methods\nRAGAS - Retrieval evaluation framework\nThis tutorial was created with \u2764\ufe0f by Greg Kamradt. MIT license, attribution is always welcome.\n\nThis tutorial will use code from LangChain (pip install langchain) & Llama Index (pip install llama-index)\n\nEvaluations\n\nIt's important to test your chunking strategies in retrieval evals. It doesn't matter how you chunk if the performance of your application isn't great.\n\nEval Frameworks:\n\nLangChain Evals\nLlama Index Evals\nRAGAS Evals\nI'm not going to demo evals for each method because success is domain specific. The arbitrary eval that I pick may not be suitable for your data. If anyone is interested in collaborating on a rigorous evaluation of different chunking strategies, please reach out (contact@dataindependent.com).\n",
    "If you only walk away from this tutorial with one thing have it be the The Chunking Commandment\n\nThe Chunking Commandment: Your goal is not to chunk for chunking sake, our goal is to get our data in a format where it can be retrieved for value later.\n\nLevel 1: Character Splitting\nCharacter splitting is the most basic form of splitting up your text. It is the process of simply dividing your text into N-character sized chunks regardless of their content or form.\n\nThis method isn't recommended for any applications - but it's a great starting point for us to understand the basics.\n\nPros: Easy & Simple\nCons: Very rigid and doesn't take into account the structure of your text\nConcepts to know:\n\nChunk Size - The number of characters you would like in your chunks. 50, 100, 100,000, etc.\nChunk Overlap - The amount you would like your sequential chunks to overlap. This is to try to avoid cutting a single piece of context into multiple pieces. This will create duplicate data across chunks.\nFirst let's get some sample text\n\ntext = \"This is the text I would like to chunk up. It is the example text for this exercise\"\nThen let's split this text manually\n\n# Create a list that will hold your chunks\nchunks = []\n\nchunk_size = 35 # Characters\n\n# Run through the a range with the length of your text and iterate every chunk_size you want\nfor i in range(0, len(text), chunk_size):\n    chunk = text[i:i + chunk_size]\n    chunks.append(chunk)\nchunks\n['This is the text I would like to ch',\n 'unk up. It is the example text for ',\n 'this exercise']\nCongratulations! You just split your first text. We have long way to go but you're already making progress. Feel like a language model practitioner yet?\n\nWhen working with text in the language model world, we don't deal with raw strings. It is more common to work with documents. Documents are objects that hold the text you're concerned with, but also additional metadata which makes filtering and manipulation easier later.\n\nWe could convert our list of strings into documents, but I'd rather start from scratch and create the docs.\n\nLet's load up LangChains CharacterSplitter to do this for us\n\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter",
    "Then let's load up this text splitter. I need to specify chunk overlap and separator or else we'll get funk results. We'll get into those next\n\ntext_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size = 35, chunk_overlap=0, separator='', strip_whitespace=False)\nThen we can actually split our text via create_documents. Note: create_documents expects a list of texts, so if you just have a string (like we do) you'll need to wrap it in []\n\ntext_splitter.create_documents([text])\n[Document(page_content='This is the text I would like to ch'),\n Document(page_content='unk up. It is the example text for '),\n Document(page_content='this exercise')]\nNotice how this time we have the same chunks, but they are in documents. These will play nicely with the rest of the LangChain world. Also notice how the trailing whitespace on the end of the 2nd chunk is missing. This is because LangChain removes it, see this line for where they do it. You can avoid this with strip_whitespace=False\n\nChunk Overlap & Separators\n\nChunk overlap will blend together our chunks so that the tail of Chunk #1 will be the same thing and the head of Chunk #2 and so on and so forth.\n\nThis time I'll load up my overlap with a value of 4, this means 4 characters of overlap\n\ntext_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size = 35, chunk_overlap=4, separator='')\ntext_splitter.create_documents([text])\n[Document(page_content='This is the text I would like to ch'),\n Document(page_content='o chunk up. It is the example text'),\n Document(page_content='ext for this exercise')]\nNotice how we have the same chunks, but now there is overlap between 1 & 2 and 2 & 3. The 'o ch' on the tail of Chunk #1 matches the 'o ch' of the head of Chunk #2.\n\nI wanted a better way to visualize this, so I made ChunkViz.com to help show it. Here's what the same text looks like.\n\nimage\nstatic/ChunkVizCharacterRecursive.png\n\nCheck out how we have three colors, with two overlaping sections.\n\nSeparators are character(s) sequences you would like to split on. Say you wanted to chunk your data at ch, you can specify it.\n\ntext_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size = 35, chunk_overlap=0, separator='ch')",
    "text_splitter.create_documents([text])\n[Document(page_content='This is the text I would like to'),\n Document(page_content='unk up. It is the example text for this exercise')]\nLlama Index\nLlama Index is a great choice for flexibility in the chunking and indexing process. They provide node relationships out of the box which can aid in retrieval later.\n\nLet's take a look at their sentence splitter. It is similar to the character splitter, but using its default settings, it'll split on sentences instead.\n\nfrom llama_index.text_splitter import SentenceSplitter\nfrom llama_index import SimpleDirectoryReader\nLoad up your splitter\n\nsplitter = SentenceSplitter(\n    chunk_size=200,\n    chunk_overlap=15,\n)\nLoad up your document\n\ndocuments = SimpleDirectoryReader(\n    input_files=[\"../../data/PGEssays/mit.txt\"]\n).load_data()\nCreate your nodes. Nodes are similar to documents but with more relationship data added to them.\n\nnodes = splitter.get_nodes_from_documents(documents)\nThen let's take a look at one\n\nnodes[0]",

    "As you can see there is a lot more relationship data held within Llama Index's nodes. We'll talk about those later, I don't want to get ahead of ourselves\n\nBasic Character splitting is likely only useful for a few applications, maybe yours!\n\nLevel 2: Recursive Character Text Splitting\nLet's jump a level of complexity.\n\nThe problem with Level #1 is that we don't take into account the structure of our document at all. We simply split by a fix number of characters.\n\nThe Recursive Character Text Splitter helps with this. With it, we'll specify a series of separatators which will be used to split our docs.\n\nYou can see the default separators for LangChain here. Let's take a look at them one by one.\n\n\"\\n\\n\" - Double new line, or most commonly paragraph breaks\n\"\\n\" - New lines\n\" \" - Spaces\n\"\" - Characters\nI'm not sure why a period (\".\") isn't included on the list, perhaps it is not universal enough? If you know, let me know.\n\nThis is the swiss army knife of splitters and my first choice when mocking up a quick application. If you don't know which splitter to start with, this is a good first bet.\n\nLet's try it out\n\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\nThen let's load up a larger piece of text\n\ntext = \"\"\"\nOne of the most important things I didn't understand about the world when I was a child is the degree to which the returns for performance are superlinear.\n\nTeachers and coaches implicitly told us the returns were linear. \"You get out,\" I heard a thousand times, \"what you put in.\" They meant well, but this is rarely true. If your product is only half as good as your competitor's, you don't get half as many customers. You get no customers, and you go out of business.\n\nIt's obviously true that the returns for performance are superlinear in business. Some think this is a flaw of capitalism, and that if we changed the rules it would stop being true. But superlinear returns for performance are a feature of the world, not an artifact of rules we've invented. We see the same pattern in fame, power, military victories, knowledge, and even benefit to humanity. In all of these, the rich get richer. [1]\n\"\"\"\nNow let's make our text splitter\n",
    "text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size = 65, chunk_overlap=0)\ntext_splitter.create_documents([text])\n[Document(page_content=\"One of the most important things I didn't understand about the\"),\n Document(page_content='world when I was a child is the degree to which the returns for'),\n Document(page_content='performance are superlinear.'),\n Document(page_content='Teachers and coaches implicitly told us the returns were linear.'),\n Document(page_content='\"You get out,\" I heard a thousand times, \"what you put in.\" They'),\n Document(page_content='meant well, but this is rarely true. If your product is only'),\n Document(page_content=\"half as good as your competitor's, you don't get half as many\"),\n Document(page_content='customers. You get no customers, and you go out of business.'),\n Document(page_content=\"It's obviously true that the returns for performance are\"),\n Document(page_content='superlinear in business.

But superlinear returns for performance are a feature of'),\n Document(page_content=\"the world, not an artifact of rules we've invented. We see the\"),\n Document(page_content='same pattern in fame, power, military victories, knowledge, and'),\n Document(page_content='even benefit to humanity. In all of these, the rich get richer.'),\n Document(page_content='[1]')]\nNotice how now there are more chunks that end with a period \".\". This is because those likely are the end of a paragraph and the splitter first looks for double new lines (paragraph break).\n\nOnce paragraphs are split, then it looks at the chunk size, if a chunk is too big, then it'll split by the next separator. If the chunk is still too big, then it'll move onto the next one and so forth.\n\nFor text of this size, let's split on something bigger.\n\ntext_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size = 450, chunk_overlap=0)\ntext_splitter.create_documents([text])\n[Document(page_content=\"One of the most important things I didn't understand about the world when I was a child is the degree to which the returns for performance are superlinear.\"),",
    " Document(page_content='Teachers and coaches implicitly told us the returns were linear. \"You get out,\" I heard a thousand times, \"what you put in.\" They meant well, but this is rarely true.

We see the same pattern in fame, power, military victories, knowledge, and even benefit to humanity. In all of these, the rich get richer. [1]\")]\nFor this text, 450 splits the paragraphs perfectly. You can even switch the chunk size to 469 and get the same splits. This is because this splitter builds in a bit of cushion and wiggle room to allow your chunks to 'snap' to the nearest separator.\n\nLet's view this visually\n\nimage\nWow - you already made it to level 2, awesome! We're on a roll. If you like the content, I send updates to email subscribers on projects I'm working on. If you want to get the scoop, sign up here.\n\nLevel 3: Document Specific Splitting\nStepping up our levels ladder, let's start to handle document types other than normal prose in a .txt. What if you have pictures? or a PDF? or code snippets?\n\nOur first two levels wouldn't work great for this so we'll need to find a different tactic.\n\nThis level is all about making your chunking strategy fit your different data formats. Let's run through a bunch of examples of this in action\n\nThe Markdown, Python, and JS splitters will basically be similar to Recursive Character, but with different separators.\n\nSee all of LangChains document splitters here and Llama Index (HTML, JSON, Markdown)\n\nMarkdown\nYou can see the separators here.\n\nSeparators:\n\n\\n#{1,6} - Split by new lines followed by a header (H1 through H6)\n```\\n - Code blocks\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*+\\n - Horizontal Lines\n\\n---+\\n - Horizontal Lines\n\\n___+\\n - Horizontal Lines\n\\n\\n Double new lines\n\\n - New line",
    "\" \" - Spaces\n\"\" - Character\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import MarkdownTextSplitter\nsplitter = MarkdownTextSplitter(chunk_size = 40, chunk_overlap=0)\nmarkdown_text = \"\"\"\n# Fun in California\n\n## Driving\n\nTry driving on the 1 down to San Diego\n\n### Food\n\nMake sure to eat a burrito while you're there\n\n## Hiking\n\nGo to Yosemite\n\"\"\"\nsplitter.create_documents([markdown_text])\n[Document(page_content='# Fun in California\\n\\n## Driving'),\n Document(page_content='Try driving on the 1 down to San Diego'),\n Document(page_content='### Food'),\n Document(page_content=\"Make sure to eat a burrito while you're\"),\n Document(page_content='there'),\n Document(page_content='## Hiking\\n\\nGo to Yosemite')]\nNotice how the splits gravitate towards markdown sections. However, it's still not perfect. Check out how there is a chunk with just \"there\" in it. You'll run into this at low-sized chunks.\n\nPython\nSee the python splitters here\n\n\\nclass - Classes first\n\\ndef - Functions next\n\\n\\tdef - Indented functions\n\\n\\n - Double New lines\n\\n - New Lines\n\" \" - Spaces\n\"\" - Characters\nLet's load up our splitter\n\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import PythonCodeTextSplitter\npython_text = \"\"\"\nclass Person:\n  def __init__(self, name, age):\n    self.name = name\n    self.age = age\n\np1 = Person(\"John\", 36)\n\nfor i in range(10):\n    print (i)\n\"\"\"\npython_splitter = PythonCodeTextSplitter(chunk_size=100, chunk_overlap=0)\npython_splitter.create_documents([python_text])\n[Document(page_content='class Person:\\n  def __init__(self, name, age):\\n    self.name = name\\n    self.age = age'),\n Document(page_content='p1 = Person(\"John\", 36)\\n\\nfor i in range(10):\\n    print (i)')]\nCheck out how the class stays together in a single document (good), then the rest of the code is in a second document (ok).\n\nI needed to play with the chunk size to get a clean result like that. You'll likely need to do the same for yours which is why using evaluations to determine optimal chunk sizes is crucial.\n\nJS\nVery similar to python. See the separators here.\n\nSeparators:\n\n\\nfunction - Indicates the beginning of a function declaration\n\\nconst - Used for declaring constant variables",
    "\\nlet - Used for declaring block-scoped variables\n\\nvar - Used for declaring a variable\n\\nclass - Indicates the start of a class definition\n\\nif - Indicates the beginning of an if statement\n\\nfor - Used for for-loops\n\\nwhile - Used for while-loops\n\\nswitch - Used for switch statements\n\\ncase - Used within switch statements\n\\ndefault - Also used within switch statements\n\\n\\n - Indicates a larger separation in text or code\n\\n - Separates lines of code or text\n\" \" - Separates words or tokens in the code\n\"\" - Makes every character a separate element\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, Language\njavascript_text = \"\"\"\n// Function is called, the return value will end up in x\nlet x = myFunction(4, 3);\n\nfunction myFunction(a, b) {\n// Function returns the product of a and b\n  return a * b;\n}\n\"\"\"\njs_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.from_language(\n    language=Language.JS, chunk_size=65, chunk_overlap=0\n)\njs_splitter.create_documents([javascript_text])\n[Document(page_content='// Function is called, the return value will end up in x'),\n Document(page_content='let x = myFunction(4, 3);'),\n Document(page_content='function myFunction(a, b) {'),\n Document(page_content='// Function returns the product of a and b\\n  return a * b;\\n}')]\nPDFs w/ tables\nOk now things will get a bit spicier.\n\nPDFs are an extremely common data type for language model work. Often they'll contain tables that contain information.\n\nThis could be financial data, studies, academic papers, etc.\n\nTrying to split tables by a character based separator isn't reliable. We need to try out a different method. For a deep dive on this I recommend checking out Lance Martin's tutorial w/ LangChain.\n\nI'll be going through a text based methods. Mayo has also outlined a GPT-4V method which tries to pulls tables via vision rather than text. You can check out here.\n\nA very convenient way to do this is with Unstructured, a library dedicated to making your data LLM ready.\n\nimport os\nfrom unstructured.partition.pdf import partition_pdf\nfrom unstructured.staging.base import elements_to_json\nLet's load up our PDF and then parition it. This is a PDF from a Salesforce earning report.\n\nfilename = \"static/SalesforceFinancial.pdf\"\n",
    "# Extracts the elements from the PDF\nelements = partition_pdf(\n    filename=filename,\n\n    # Unstructured Helpers\n    strategy=\"hi_res\", \n    infer_table_structure=True, \n    model_name=\"yolox\"\n)\nSome weights of the model checkpoint at microsoft/table-transformer-structure-recognition were not used when initializing TableTransformerForObjectDetection: ['model.backbone.conv_encoder.model.layer3.0.downsample.1.num_batches_tracked', 'model.backbone.conv_encoder.model.layer4.0.downsample.1.num_batches_tracked', 'model.backbone.conv_encoder.model.layer2.0.downsample.1.num_batches_tracked']\n- This IS expected if you are initializing TableTransformerForObjectDetection from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).\n- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing TableTransformerForObjectDetection from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).\nLet's look at our elements\n\nelements\n[<unstructured.documents.elements.NarrativeText at 0x2bdecbfd0>,\n <unstructured.documents.elements.NarrativeText at 0x2ad356cd0>,\n <unstructured.documents.elements.NarrativeText at 0x2ba4e0cd0>,\n <unstructured.documents.elements.NarrativeText at 0x2af4148d0>,\n <unstructured.documents.elements.NarrativeText at 0x2ba846c90>,\n <unstructured.documents.elements.NarrativeText at 0x2ba8450d0>,\n <unstructured.documents.elements.NarrativeText at 0x2ba844990>,\n <unstructured.documents.elements.NarrativeText at 0x2ba944490>,\n <unstructured.documents.elements.Table at 0x2ba947b50>,\n <unstructured.documents.elements.NarrativeText at 0x2ad3d4f50>,\n <unstructured.documents.elements.Text at 0x2ba969f50>,\n <unstructured.documents.elements.Text at 0x177a411d0>]\nThese are just unstructured objects, we could look at them all but I want to look at the table it parsed.\n\nelements[-4].metadata.text_as_html",
    "'<table><thead><th>Revenue)</th><th>Guidance $7.69 - $7.70 Billion</th><th>Guidance $31.7 - $31.8 Billion</th></thead><tr><td>Y/Y Growth</td><td>~21%</td><td>~20%</td></tr><tr><td>FX Impact?)</td><td>~($200M) y/y FX</td><td>~($600M) y/y FX\u00ae</td></tr><tr><td>GAAP operating margin</td><td></td><td>~3.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Non-GAAP operating margin)</td><td></td><td>~20.4%</td></tr><tr><td>GAAP earnings (loss) per share</td><td>($0.03) - ($0.02)</td><td>$0.38 - $0.40</td></tr><tr><td>Non-GAAP earnings per share</td><td>$1.01 - $1.02</td><td>$4.74 - $4.76</td></tr><tr><td>Operating Cash Flow Growth (Y/Y)</td><td></td><td>~21% - 22%</td></tr><tr><td>Current Remaining Performance Obligation Growth (Y/Y)</td><td>~15%</td><td></td></tr></table>'\nThat table may look messy, but because it's in HTML format, the LLM is able to parse it much more easily than if it was tab or comma separated. You can copy and paste that html into a html viewer online to see it reconstructed.\n\nimage\nAwesome, Unstructured was able to pull out the tables for us. It's not perfect, but the team is upgrading their toolset all the time.\n\nImportant Point: Later on when we are doing semantic search over our chunks, trying to match on embeddings from the table directly will be difficult. A common practice that developers do is to summarize the table after you've extracted it. Then get an embedding of that summary. If the summary embedding matches what you're looking for, then pass the raw table to your LLM.\n\nMulti-Modal (text + images)",
    "Next we'll dive into the world of multi-modal text splitting. This is a very active field and best practices are evolving. I'll show you a method that was made popular by Lance Martin of LangChain. You can check out his source code here.

Though a bit outside the scope of chunking, let's talk about how to work with these.\n\nThe common tactics will either use a multi-modal model to generate summaries of the images or use the image itself for your task.

    "There has to be a better way - let's explore and find out.\n\nEmbeddings represent the semantic meaning of a string. They don't do much on their own, but when compared to embeddings of other texts you can start to infer the relationship between chunks. I want to lean into this property and explore using embeddings to find clusters of semantically similar texts.\n\nThe hypothesis is that semantically similar chunks should be held together.\n\nI tried a few methods:\n\nHeirarchical clustering with positional reward - I wanted to see how heirarchical clustering of sentence embeddings would do. But because I chose to split on sentences, there was an issue with small short sentences after a long one. You know? (like this last sentenence). They could change the meaning of a chunk, so I added a positional reward and clusters were more likely to form if they were sentences next to each other. This ended up being ok, but tuning the parameters was slow and unoptimal.\nFind break points between sequential sentences - Next up I tried a walk method. I started at the first sentence, got the embedding, then compared it to sentence #2, then compared #2 and #3 and so on. I was looking for \"break points\" where embedding distance was large. If it was above a threshold, then I considered it the start of a new semantic section. I originally tried taking embeddings of every sentence, but this turned out to be too noisy. So I ended up taking groups of 3 sentences (a window), then got an embedding, then dropped the first sentence, and added the next one. This worked out a bit better.\nI'll show method #2 here - It's not perfect by any means, but it's a good starting point for an exploration and I'd love to hear about how you think it could be improved.\n\nFirst, let's load up our essay that we'll run through.

    "But what if your raw text isn't the best way to represent your data for your task?\n\nFor example, if you're doing semantic search on chat messages, raw chat messages may lack the context to make a successful embedding. Maybe actually trying to semantic search of a summary of a conversation would do better. Or maybe hypothetical questions that the chat would answer?\n\nThis is where the world of chunking/splitting starts to dive into the world of indexing. When you index, you're making a choice about how you want to represent your data in your data base or knowledge base.\n\nThis is more of a retrieval topic, but it's worth talking about with chunking.\n\nLet's quickly go through a few popular alternative ways developers like to represent their data. There are unlimited methods to try. We'll review 4 of them\n\nMulti-Vector Indexing - This is when you do semantic search for a vector that is derived from something other than your raw text\nSummaries - A summary of your chunk\nHypothetical questions - Good for chat messages used as knowledge base\nChild Documents - Parent Document Retriever\nGraph Based Chunking - Transposing your raw text into a graph structure\nSummaries\nInstead of embedding your raw text, embed a summary of your raw text which will have more dense information\n\nimport uuid\n\nfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\nfrom langchain_core.documents import Document\nfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\nfrom langchain.retrievers.multi_vector import MultiVectorRetriever\nfrom langchain.storage import InMemoryByteStore\nfrom langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import Chroma\nLet's use our Super Linear essay again. I'll split it into large chunks\n\nwith open('../../data/PGEssays/superlinear.txt') as file:\n    essay = file.read()\n\nsplitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=4000, chunk_overlap=0)\n\ndocs = splitter.create_documents([essay])\n\nprint (f\"You have {len(docs)} docs\")\nYou have 6 docs\nSpin up a chain that will quickly summarize for you\n\nchain = (\n    {\"doc\": lambda x: x.page_content}\n    | ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(\"Summarize the following document:\\n\\n{doc}\")\n    | ChatOpenAI(max_retries=0)\n    | StrOutputParser()\n)\nThen let's get the summaries\n",
    "summaries = chain.batch(docs, {\"max_concurrency\": 5})\nLet's look at a sample\n\nsummaries[0]\n\"The document discusses the concept of superlinear returns for performance, where the rewards for performance are not proportional to the effort put in. It explains that this concept is present in various aspects of life, such as business, fame, power, military victories, and benefit to humanity. The document emphasizes the importance of understanding this concept, especially for ambitious individuals. It also discusses how exponential growth and thresholds are fundamental causes of superlinear returns, using examples such as bacterial cultures and startups. The document also mentions Y Combinator's focus on growth rate as a key factor in achieving exponential growth. Additionally, it explores how humans are not naturally accustomed to exponential growth and discusses historical examples of exponential growth, such as empires.\"\nThen we are going to create a vectorstore (holds vectors + summaries) and a docstore (holds raw docs)\n\n# The vectorstore to use to index the child chunks\nvectorstore = Chroma(collection_name=\"summaries\", embedding_function=OpenAIEmbeddings())\n\n# The storage layer for the parent documents\nstore = InMemoryByteStore()\n\nid_key = \"doc_id\"\n\n# The retriever (empty to start)\nretriever = MultiVectorRetriever(\n    vectorstore=vectorstore,\n    byte_store=store,\n    id_key=id_key,\n)\ndoc_ids = [str(uuid.uuid4()) for _ in docs]\nThen you want to create documents out of your summary list, add the doc_id to it's metadata. This will tie it back to the original document so you know which summary goes with which original doc.\n\nsummary_docs = [\n    Document(page_content=s, metadata={id_key: doc_ids[i]})\n    for i, s in enumerate(summaries)\n]\nThen add them both to your vectorestore and docstore. When you add the docs to the vectorstore it will get the embeddings for them too.\n\n# Adds the summaries\nretriever.vectorstore.add_documents(summary_docs)\n\n# Adds the raw documents\nretriever.docstore.mset(list(zip(doc_ids, docs)))\nThen if you want you can add the original docs to the vectorstore as well. Just make sure to add the doc id to it as well so you can tie it all together\n\n# for i, doc in enumerate(docs):\n#     doc.metadata[id_key] = doc_ids[i]",
    "# retriever.vectorstore.add_documents(docs)\nGreat, now that we've done all that work, let's try a search. If you run the code below, you'll search on the summary embeddings, but you'll get the raw documents returned.\n\n# retriever.get_relevant_documents(query=\"the concept of superlinear returns, which refers to the idea that the returns for performance are not linear\")\nHypothetical Questions\nYou can generate hypothetical questions about your raw documents. Check out LangChain's implementation of it for more information.\n\nThis is espeically helpful when you have sparse unstructured data, like chat messages.\n\nSay you were to build a bot that uses slack conversations as a knowledge base. Trying to do semantic search on raw chat messages might not have the greatest results. However, if you were to generate hypothetical questions that the slack messages would answer, then when you get a new question in, you'll likely have a better chance matching.\n\nThe code for this will be the same as the summary code, but instead of asking the LLM to make a summary, you'll ask it for hypothetical questions.\n\nParent Document Retriever (PDR)\nMuch like the previous two, Parent Document Retriever builds on the concept of doing semantic search on a varied representation of your data.\n\nThe hypothesis with the PDR is that smaller chunks have a higher likely hood of being matched semantically with a potential query. However, those smaller chunks may not have all the context they need, so instead of passing the smaller chunks to your LLM, get the parent chunk of the smaller chunk. This means you get a larger chunk which the smaller chunk is placed in.\n\nCheck out LangChain's implementation's implementation of it here.\n\nI have a full tutorial on it at FullStackRetrieval.com if you want to go deeper on that.\n\nI want to quickly go over a similar method in Llama Index with their HierarchicalNodeParser which will split a document at various chunk sizes (there will be a bunch of overlaps but that is the purpose). When combined with their AutoMergingRetriever you can do complicated retrieval easily. Their walkthrough here.\n\nfrom llama_index.node_parser import HierarchicalNodeParser\n\nnode_parser = HierarchicalNodeParser.from_defaults(\n    chunk_sizes=[2048, 512, 128],\n    chunk_overlap=0\n)\ndocuments = SimpleDirectoryReader(\n    input_files=[\"../../data/PGEssays/mit.txt\"]\n).load_data()",
    "Then let's do our splitting.
